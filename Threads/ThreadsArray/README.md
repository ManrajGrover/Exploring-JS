# ThreadsArray
This project demonstrates summing of array of integers of long type using iterative method as well as parallelly using threads.

## How to run the project

1. Download the zip file and extract it in your workspace.
2. Change directory to the extracted folder.
3. Run `javac src/*` to compile the project.
4. Change directory to src and run `java ArraySum` to run the project.

## What it does?

1. On running the project, it creates an array of size 100000000 and populates it with integers.
2. It uses 15 threads to sum the array parallelly and shows the sum and time taken to execute the code.
3. It then sums the array iteratively and shows the sum and time taken to execute the code.
